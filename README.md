# PROJECT-HILSHA

This Project Started from my intention to build A rover. And I needed autonomy for autonomy I needed mission planning and for mission planning I needed a specific type of flight Controller.
That is Dual IMU rebundancy Flight controller cheapest one to have this is about $70 plus minus $5 with 10-15$ shipping.


 And that is without shipping and Mine is little lower but with double better components than that specifically 83.49$ with shipping.

This is actually a clone so that I can get firmware support from Mission Planner. For the Firmware I chose pixracer a discontinued Flight Controller board. Surprisingly it still supports mission planner till now and has dedicated ESP-01 port fot wifi logging. That is actually Nice.
