## Note before reading

I honestly didn't know how to write a journal or what it exactly means, so I struggled to register daily logs. This is my raw, honest, daily record for GitHub, capturing the exact things I did and my frustrations.

## Day 1 ‚Äì Dopamine Rush & Existential Crisis (28 JUNE 2025)

Saw the IRO post.  
Got hyped.  
Realized I have no project.  
Got depressed.  

Main theme: **Space Robots.**  
Brain: "We can totally build a Lunar Cave Explorer Robot."  
Reality: "Can we though?"  

Proceeded to conduct "research" (read: aggressively Googling at 3 AM).  
Found nothing that says "you can‚Äôt do it," which made me **even more excited**.  
**Conclusion:** If no one did it yet, that‚Äôs a *feature*. ~ 2 hours

## Day 2 ‚Äì Flight Controller Rabbit Hole (29 JUNE 2025)

Dual gyro-redundancy flight controllers?  
**Hell crazy expensive + not even mini.**

Me: "Ok, let‚Äôs clone one."  
Dived into ArduPilot‚Äôs site like a smurf looking for berries.  
Found an open-source controller with:

‚úÖ ArduPilot compatibility  
‚úÖ Dual gyro  
‚úÖ Open schematics  
‚úÖ 3D files  
‚úÖ ‚ÄúBeyond‚Äù files (whatever those are)  

**Best part:** Found third-party retailers from ‚ÄúBangdoodh‚Äù (Banggood, but my dopamine-addled brain read it wrong) selling them for **$75 instead of $200+.**

**Bad news:** It‚Äôs discontinued, but hey, still supported for normal Pixhawk versions.

Sadly, Pixhawk normal versions are big chonks, not fitting my tiny lunar bot dreams.  
Also, they don‚Äôt give me a *dedicated Wi-Fi data link* for easy log transfers.  
That‚Äôs why I decided: **I‚Äôm cloning it.**

*Note: I still don‚Äôt know how to write a journal properly, so here it is in my chaos style. Enjoy the ride as I try to build a lunar cave explorer while riding dopamine waves.*

~ 3 hours


## Day 3 ‚Äì The ‚ÄúWhich Schematic Is It‚Äù Saga (30 JUNE 2025)

I found out the schematic linked in the repo wasn‚Äôt even for the **PixRacer** I‚Äôm trying to clone.  
Apparently, there are **a billion PixRacer versions:**

- Pixhawk version  
- Holybro version  
- [Insert another vendor here] version

Result: *Confusion and mild mental dismantlement*.

I **smurfed** (stalked) the owner‚Äôs GitHub repo like a raccoon in a trash can until I *finally* found the exact schematics and design files.

Bad news: All of it was in **Altium Designer** (aka *LTM designer in my brain*), which is hella expensive and doesn‚Äôt give student packages for high school students.  
Result: Got **rekt again**.

To keep sanity, I decided to **redraw the schematics in EasyEDA** for my understanding and rebuild it from scratch.  
Oh, and some schematics were *missing parts in the middle*.

---

*Note: I still don‚Äôt know how to write a journal, but this chaos is now immortalized for future me (or future contributors) to understand why I‚Äôm building a lunar cave explorer bot while battling overpriced CAD tools.* ~ 6 hours

## Day 4 ‚Äì PCB Existential Crisis (1 July 2025)

**Working on schematics again. Working on schematics again.**

Finally, **finished the schematics** (üéâ tiny victory).  
Now came the **worst nightmare: component sourcing**.

- ‚ÄúWhich capacitor should I use, 0603 or 0402?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhat should I include in my PCB design?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhat should my PCB layout look like?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúHow do I make it look exactly the same as the reference?‚Äù

When I redrew the schematic in EasyEDA, I *forgot* I would actually have to **lay out a PCB too.**

The open-source hardware repo had a PCB in Altium Designer (or *LTM designer* in my caffeine brain), but I couldn‚Äôt find a clean PCB export, only schematics.

What did I do?  
Went back to the GitHub repo, found an **`.ltm` file** (still don‚Äôt know what that means).

Uploaded it to an LTM viewer. Boom:  
**Turns out you can download the PCB separately from there.**

So I did exactly that. ~ 4 hours

## Day 5 ‚Äì BOM Madness & SMD Headache ( 9 July 2025)

Took a **1-week break** (exams cooked my brain üß†üî•).  
Came back, saw my PCB files, and stepped into **Day 5: Component Sourcing Hell.**

Making the BOM should‚Äôve been chill. Sourcing **MCU and gyros? Easy.**  
But then came **the mini demons: capacitors and resistors.**

I didn‚Äôt realize they have *footprints* (apparently called SMD components) that you have to match *exactly*.  
Found out my **normal soldering iron won‚Äôt even work**, and I need a **hot air gun** just to put these rice-sized components on.

At that point, I left the ‚Äúhow to solder‚Äù thought for Future Me and focused on **collecting parts**.

Went to **LCSC**, started sourcing by footprint, one by one:  
‚úÖ Check footprint  
‚úÖ Check resistance  
‚úÖ Check temperature rating  
‚úÖ Check if thick or thin film

It was **one of the most boring, soul-draining things ever.**

It **took the whole day** just to make the BOM, checking every single component while my sanity slowly evaporated.

Worst part? **My IMU sensors and gyro chips were out of stock on LCSC.**

Checked AliExpress:
- Only breakout boards, not the raw SMD chips.
- If there were raw SMD chips, there were like 16-20 in stock, and I *do not trust that*.

By the end, I was **totally cooked**, but at least:

‚úÖ **BOM completed.**  
‚úÖ Sanity not completed.

--- ~ 9 hours

*Future note: BOM sourcing is the part no YouTube video warns you about while building your lunar cave explorer bot.*

## Day 6 ‚Äì Minor Tweaks, Major Relief (10 JULY 2025)

Today was **revision day**.

Held a quick **review session for my flight controller design** (basically me staring at EasyEDA, mumbling ‚Äúplease work‚Äù).

Did some **minor changes**:
- Tweaked a few traces
- Adjusted footprints
- Fixed silkscreen labels

And guess what? **My flight controller was ready to deploy.**

**Yeah.**

After days of chaotic sourcing, footprint checking, and schematic drawing, seeing it *ready to go* was a *tiny dopamine hit* I needed.~ 2 hours


## Day 7 ‚Äì Back from Motivation Blackhole (13 JULY 2025)

Took **2 more days off** because I lost motivation and *almost forgot about this project*.

(Blame goes to seeing **Hackclub doing GitHubHQ**, which made me want to drop everything and watch them instead. Couldn‚Äôt join, it ended, so... back to my lunar bot.)

---

Today, I started thinking about **physical deployment**:

ü™ê **Mission:**  
- How will it get to the **lunar cave?**  
- How will it *work once there?*

---

### The Plan I Cooked:

‚úÖ I‚Äôll place **two battery bases near the cave‚Äôs edge**.  
‚úÖ They will be **interconnected with a rope** under tension strong enough to hold a **winch system**.  
‚úÖ The **winch system** will lower and position the **main robot** over the cave entrance.

The **main robot** will:
- Carry the **flight controller, Raspberry Pi, and sensors**.
- Hang weightlessly, stabilized by tension, using **servos for positioning**.
- Function like a **weightless, handless drone** on a wire.

--- ~ 3 hours

Problem: I don‚Äôt know how to make it work **autonomously**, because it‚Äôs neither a rover nor a drone, just a weird *cable drone* run by **servos and wires**.

          Cave Entrance for Deployment

## Day 8 (24/07/2025)

Took a long break before starting again.

Came up with the following **detailed rope-deployed lunar cave explorer architecture**:

```
[ Rover ]
   |-- Heavy-load Servo (drops battery spike base)
   |-- Rope Tensioning Mechanism
   |-- Servo for rope bend/tension adjust
   |-- LoRa Antenna ‚Üí Mars Orbiter
   |-- Receives compressed video from Pi over tether/wireless

[ Rope (Tether) ]
   |-- PoE cable from Battery Base to Rope Center
   |-- Physical rope for tension + winch

[ Battery Spike Base ]
   |-- Power for system via PoE
   |-- Spike anchors on lunar cave floor

[ Rope Center Module ]
   |-- Raspberry Pi (3D mapping, image processing, compression)
        |-- MAVLink with Flight Controller
        |-- Controls Winch Servo
        |-- Sends compressed video to Rover
   |-- Main Winch Servo
   |-- Power distribution (FC, 3D Depth Camera, Servos)

[ 3D Mapping Module (Suspended) ]
   |-- Flight Controller (IMU, stabilization)
        |-- Servo 1: Pan camera
        |-- Servo 2: Rope tension adjust (optional)
   |-- 3D Depth Camera (depth capture)
   |-- Power from Rope Center Module via winch cable

[ Communication Flow ]
3D camera ‚Üí Flight Controller ‚Üí Pi (mapping + compression) ‚Üí Rover ‚Üí LoRa ‚Üí Mars Orbiter
```
Also sourced all components and fitted in budget. Made BOM list.
Tomorrow will be the last day of this project I hope.

~ 7 hours


## Day 9 (25 JULY 25)

I finally sat down with my thoughts and decided on the design for my glorious rover. I mean, we all want that slick, rugged, NASA-esque Mars explorer that looks like it just rolled out of a sci-fi film‚Ä¶ but alas, the Printing Legion in my country has vanished into the abyss. üé≠

The printer warriors are either extinct, hibernating, or stuck in an eternal queue. My Hackpad cases? They‚Äôve been on a voyage longer than the Voyager 1. It‚Äôs been 2 months. They may return. Or not. I tried summoning them with tracking IDs, but even the postal gods have ghosted me.

So, I reluctantly abandoned 3D printing. üò§
If you, lucky reader, have access to the sacred HackClub Printing Legion, count your blessings and check out the links below for making your own rover body. You still have hope. Don't waste it. ü´°
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1240754
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1979227

Then, I entered the realm of spreadsheets (cue dramatic music). I worked on my BEOM (Bill of Expensive Over-Engineered Materials) ‚Äî basically, the shopping list for every nut, bolt, sensor, and irrational decision I‚Äôm putting on this rover.

I also did some deep dives into power sourcing because, let‚Äôs face it, the rover won‚Äôt run on my frustration and hope alone. The verdict:

A lithium battery pack

A solar panel

And a charger module

Together, they form the Power Trifecta‚Ñ¢, giving life to my creation ‚Äî or at least, helping it blink a few LEDs before crashing due to overdraw. üîã‚ö°

And finally, I revisited the BOM again (yes, again), because my budget was tighter than the tolerances on a misaligned servo. I had to make pinpoint financial positioning, slicing costs like a samurai with a spreadsheet.

At the end of Day 9, while most people were sleeping, I was battling a very earthly villain in my Martian mission
Wires. And their love for twisting into a giant mess.

So here‚Äôs the scene:

I‚Äôve got a 3D camera mounted on a servo.

The servo does full 360¬∞ rotation.

The camera captures glorious panoramic Martian dreams.

BUT... the wires scream in pain every time the servo goes full spin.

If left unchecked, after a few spins, the wires would twist so much they‚Äôd:

Yank the USB port out,

Wrap around the servo like a python,

Or start emitting smoke signals (not the kind I want to transmit to Earth).

‚öôÔ∏è The Big Brain Fix‚Ñ¢: Ping-Pong Rotation
Instead of going full spin until it strangles itself, I engineered a plan:

üö® ‚ÄúLet the servo do 360¬∞... then go 360¬∞ back the other way... and keep alternating.‚Äù

Like a DJ scratching a record ‚Äî but in space.

So now the servo does:
360¬∞ clockwise ‚Üí pause

360¬∞ counterclockwise ‚Üí pause

Repeat like a robot doing yoga

The result?

Camera gets full field coverage üé•

Wires stay untwisted üßµ

Servo stays alive ‚öôÔ∏è

My sanity remains mostly intact üß†

üì° Bonus: Wireless Data Relay Chain
To top it off, I designed the full data relay route like this:

ESP8266 sends 3D data from the flight controller.

That gets received by a Raspberry Pi on the rotating mount (yes, the servo swingy one).

That Pi has a USB Wi-Fi dongle and beams the data to the rover's Raspberry Pi.

The rover Pi then relays the data to my PC.

In an actual Mars mission: swap Wi-Fi for LoRa ‚Üí Mars Orbiter ‚Üí Earth, boom üí´




That‚Äôs it for today‚Äôs episode.~ 4hours

## Day 10 (26 JULY 25)

I Uploaded Everything (Even My Sanity)

Today, I heroically uploaded all my files to the GitHub repo.

Then came the 3D designing session...

Conclusion:

GitHub repo = ‚úÖ Uploaded

Case designs = ‚úÖ Done

Sanity = ‚ùå Missing

Fun = üòµ evaporated somewhere in Fusion 360

BOM Update Again because better Idea clicked
