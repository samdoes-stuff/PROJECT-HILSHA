## Note before reading

I honestly didn't know how to write a journal or what it exactly means, so I struggled to register daily logs. This is my raw, honest, daily record for GitHub, capturing the exact things I did and my frustrations.

## Day -1 (Two weeks ago)

* Started planning a **Lunar Explorer Robot**.
* Searched necessary modules, sensors, and how these work.
* Spent 3 hours understanding what I need.

## Day -2

* Researched flight controllers with dual IMU, gyro, autopilot for Mars/Lunar use.
* Found them too expensive, so decided to **clone Pixracer**.
* Spent 2 hours learning what cloning requires.

## Day -3

* Spent 6 hours deep in firmware, learning what sensors are replaceable.
* Realized **MCU and gyro/barometer canâ€™t be swapped** easily.
* Started schematic design.

## Day -4

* Used open-source Pixracer schematics from GitHub.
* Fought with Altium to EasyEDA conversion for hours.
* Stressed measuring to ensure identical layout.
* 6 hours spent.

## Day -10

* Worked on **4-layer PCB routing**, separating ground and data layers.
* 2 hours spent focusing on clean lines.

## Day -9

* Sourced parts from LCSC via EasyEDA, BOM matching.
* Frustrated by **0603 vs 0402 footprints**, needed multiple revisions.
* 6 hours total.

## Day -8

* Imported components into EasyEDA Pro, ran 3D/DRC checks.
* Tested ArduPilot Pixracer firmware compatibility.
* 4 hours spent.

## Day -7

* Started **Lunar Cave Exploration Rover** planning.
* Researched LiDAR alternatives due to budget issues.
* Picked **high-quality Pi camera + LED + Arducam 3D depth camera setup**.
* Added active cooler to Pi 5.
* 4 hours spent.

## Day -6

* Thought about power delivery, PoE, winch tension systems.
* Designed a winch-deploy system with two base rovers acting as anchors.
* Planned Ethernet power delivery to flight controller + sensors.
* Spent 8 hours fully sketching and simulating this system.

## Day -5 to Day 0

* Continued parts sourcing.
* Searched Aliexpress for ICM 20608, Ampion 9250 gyro alternatives but realized firmware would break if changed.
* Requested quotes from LCSC, learned about bulk capacitor pricing and hidden cost savings.
* Practiced, revised PCB, documented all errors, and managed to keep going despite confusion.
* Spent 3-6 hours daily, depending on revision intensity and parts verification.
