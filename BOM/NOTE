I already have an raspberry pie 5 and raspberry pie 2 zero W. So in case you do not have on you may need one.

Also I have some grant leftover that I will use to cover my extras. I donot have an access to printing legion tha is why I did not do  3D models. I encourage you to do so.

OTher things that you will need that is note mentioned in BOM

Clear Box for main module (Acryclic Suggested)
rope (6mm nylon rope suggested)
Small protection Case for battery, winch servo. 3D files are available in CAD
Extra Weights for batters base
Double Sided Tape and other Mini accessories according to your creativity.
